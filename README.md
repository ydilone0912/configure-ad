<h1>On-premises Active Directory Deployed in the Cloud (Azure)</h1>
This tutorial outlines the implementation of on-premises Active Directory within Azure Virtual Machines.<br />


<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- Active Directory Domain Services
- PowerShell

<h2>Operating Systems Used </h2>

- Windows Server 2022
- Windows 10 (21H2)

<h2>High-Level Deployment and Configuration Steps</h2>

1- Create an Azure account: If you don't already have an Azure account, create one at https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/.

2- Create a Virtual Machine (VM): In the Azure portal, create a new VM and select the operating system and size that meet the requirements for osTicket.

3- Configure security settings: Configure security settings for the VM, including network security groups, firewalls, and access controls.

4- Install the web server: Install a web server such as Apache or Nginx on the VM.

5- Install PHP: Install the latest version of PHP and the required PHP extensions on the VM.

6- Install the database server: Install a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL on the VM.

7- Install osTicket: Download and install osTicket on the VM, either manually or using an automated installation script.

8- Configure osTicket: Configure osTicket by setting up departments, staff accounts, ticket forms, email settings, and other settings as required.

9- Secure osTicket: Configure osTicket to use HTTPS, set up SSL certificates, and implement other security measures to protect the system and user data.

10- Backup and recovery: Set up backup and recovery processes to ensure that data is protected in the event of a disaster or system failure.
